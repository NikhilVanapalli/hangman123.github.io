 	<p>
 	The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word. If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the computer writes it in all its correct positions. If the suggested letter or number does not occur in the word, then one element of a hanged man stick figure is drawn as a tally mark.
 	</p>
 	<p>
 	The player guessing the word may, at any time, attempt to guess the whole word. If the word is correct, the game is over and the guesser wins. Otherwise, the guesser is penalized by adding an element to the diagram.<br>On the other hand, if the player makes enough incorrect guesses to allow the computer to complete the diagram, the game is over, this time with the guesser losing. However, the guesser can win by guessing all the letters or numbers that appears in the word, thereby completing the word, before the diagram is completed.
